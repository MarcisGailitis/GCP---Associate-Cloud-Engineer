## 1. Introduction

This course is not about implementing specific cloud features, it's about architecture design and process.

Define in your case study:

- Description
- Features
- Users

## 2. Defining Services

User stories - describe a feature from the user's point of view. (As an xxx, I want to xxx so ...)

### 2.1. Requirements, Analysis, and Design

Who:

- who are the users
- who are the devs
- who are the stakeholders

What:

- what does the system do
- what are the main features

Why:

- why is the system needed?

When:

- when does the user need and/or want the solution?
- when can the developers be done?

How:

- how will the system work?
- How many users?
- How much data will there be?

Define in your case study:

- Write personas for each role
- Write user stories for each feature

### 2.2. SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs

KPIs = metrics that can be used to measure success. Must be measurable!!!

KPI != Goal:

- Goal = Outcome you want to achieve
- KPI = metric that indicates if you are on track to achieve the metrics

- SLI = Service Level Indicator = KPI (The latency of successful HTTP responses HTTP-200)
- SLO = Service Level Objective = Goal (The latency of 99% of the responses must be < 200 ms)
- SLA = Service Level Agreements = More restrictive version of the SLO (The user is compensated if 99th percentile exceeds 300 ms)

## 3. Microservice Design and Architecture

### 3.1. Microservices

![Microservices](./img/07/15_23_46.png)

Microservices divide a large program into multiple smaller, independent services.

Microservices pros:

- Easier to develop and maintain
- A reduced risk when deploying new versions
- Services scale independently to optimize the use of infrastructure
- Faster to innovate and add new features
- Can use different languages and frameworks for different services
- Choose the runtime appropriate to each service

Microservices cons:

- Increased complexity when communicating b/w services
- Increased latency across service boundaries
- Concerns about securing inter-service traffic
- Multiple deployments
- Need to ensure that you do not break clients as versions change
- Must maintain backward compatibility with clients as the microservices evolve.

The key difference between **stateful** and **stateless** microservices is that:

- stateless microservices donâ€™t store data on the host, whereas
- stateful microservices require some kind of storage on the host who serves the requests.

### 3.2. Microservices 12-factor app

1. Codebase:
    - one codebase tracked in version control, many deploys
    - track each app in a separate repo
2. Dependencies:
    - explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    - declare dependencies and use a package manager to install dependencies
3. Config:
    - store config in the environment
    - do not put secrets in the source code, use env. variables instead
4. Backing services:
    - treat backing services as attached resources
    - databases, cache, etc are accessed via URLs
5. Build, Release, Run:
    - strictly separate build and run stages
    - build = deployment package from the source code; release = deployment package + config; run = executes the app
6. Processes:
    - execute the app as one or more stateless processes
    - each instance of the app gets its data from a separate DB service
7. Port Binding:
    - expose services via port binding
    - apps are self-contained and expose a port & protocol internally.
8. Concurrency:
    - scale-out via the process model
    - as apps are self-contained and run in separate processes, they scale easily by adding instances.
9. Disposability:
    - maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
    - if an instance is not needed, you should be able to turn it off with no side effects
10. Dev/Prod Parity:
    - keep dev/staging/prod as simple as possible
    - leverage IaC and containers to make environments easier to use
11. Logs:
    - treat logs as event streams
    - write log msgs to STOUT and aggregate logs to a single source
12. Admin processes:
    - run admin/mgmt tasks as repeatable processes, not one-off manual tasks
    - admin tasks should not be part of the application

### 3.3. REST

Services communicate via HTTPS using text-based payloads:

- client makes GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE request
- body of the request is formatted as JSON or XML
- response is returned as JSON, XML or HTML

REST = Representational State Transfer:

- protocol-independent: HTTP, gRPC
- service endpoints supporting REST are called RESTful
- client/server communicate with Request/Response processing

RESTful services communicate over the web using HTTPS:

- URIs (or endpoints) identify resources
- REST apps provide consistent, uniform interfaces
- caching of immutable representations is appropriate

### 3.4. APIs

It is important to design consistent APIs for services. OpenAPI is an industry-standard for exposing APIs to clients:

- standard interface description format for the rest APIs
- allows tools and humans to understand how to use service w/o needing its source code

## 4. DevOps Automation

### 4.1. CI Pipelines

1. Developers check-in code:
    - Use a Git repo for each microservice and branches for versions
2. Run unit tests:
    - if the tests do not pass, stop
3. Build deployment package:
    - Create Docker image
4. Deploy:
    - Save your new Docker image in a container registry

Cloud Source Repo:
    - provides managed Git Repos
    - developers push to a central repo when they want a build to occur
Cloud Build:
    - Google-hosted Docker build service, an alternative to using Docker build command.
    - build system executes the steps required to make a deployment package or Docker image
Build triggers:
    - watch a repo and build a container whenever code is pushed (Maven, custom builds, and Docker)
    - watches the changes in the Git repo and starts the build
Container Registry:
    - Google-cloud hosted Docker Repo
    - Store your docker images or deployment packages in a central location for deployment

### 4.2. IaC

In the cloud, all infrastructure needs to be disposable. IaC allows for the quick provisioning and removing of infra:

- build an infra when needed
- destroy the infra when not in use
- create identical infra for dev/test/prod
- can be part of CI/CD
- templates are the building blocks for disaster recovery (DR)
- manage resource dependencies and complexity

Deployment Manager if Google Cloud native IaC Tool:

- define infra using YAML
- can create dynamic templates using Py or Jinja
- use gcloud to create, update and delete deployments

Terraform is similar to Deployment Manager but can be used on multiple public/private clouds:

- considered as the first-class tool in Google Cloud

## 5. Choosing Storage Solutions

    - Cloud SQL (up to 30 TB)
    - Cloud Spanner
2. NoSQL
    - Firestore
    - Bigtable
3. Object
    - Cloud Storage
4. Warehouse

Amount of data & nr of reads/writes:

1. Scales Horizontally (by adding nodes)
    - Cloud Spanner
    - Cloud Bigtable
2. Scales vertically (by making machines larger)
    - Cloud SQL
    - Memorystore
3. Scales automatically w/o limits

    - Firestore

Strong consistency options:

1. Strong consistency by updating all copies within a transaction:
    - Cloud Storage
    - Cloud SQL
    - Spanner
    - Firestore
2. Eventually consistent - update main and the rest async
    - Bigtable nodes
    - Memorystore replicas

### 5.2. Choosing GCP storage and data solutions

## 6. Google Cloud and Hybrid Network Architecture

### 6.1. Designing Google Cloud Networks

VPC global, subnet = regional, instances are zonal.

- Global LBs provide access to services deployed in multiple regions. HTTPS, TCP Proxy and SSL Proxy.
- Regional LBs provide access to services deployed in a single region HTTPS, TCP LB, and UDP LB.

Cloud CDN for lower latency and decreased egress cost. Caches static content worldwide using GCP edge-cashing locations.

### 6.2. Connecting Networks

- Classic VPN - low volume data connections 99.9%. HA VPN = 2 connections 99.99%. up to 3Gbps per tunnel
- VPC Network Peering
- Cloud Interconnect for GCP - from 10 to 200 Gbps

## 7. Deploying Applications to Google Cloud

![Choosing a GCP deployment platform](./img/07/12_50_42.png)

### 7.1. GCP IaaS

- Compute Instance
- Instance Groups

### 7.2. GCP Deployment Platforms

- GKE
- Cloud Run
- App Engine - App -> Services -> Versions -> Instances
- Cloud Functions

## 8. Designing Reliable Systems

### 8.1. Key Performance Metrics

- Availability - the percent of the time a system is running and able to process requests
  - achieved with fault tolerance
  - use health checks
- Durability - The odds of losing data because of a hardware or system failure
  - achieved by replicating data in multiple zones
  - do regular backups
- Scalability - The ability of a system to continue to work as user load and data grows
  - use capacity autoscaling

### 8.2. Design for Reliability

- Avoid single points of failure, a spare spare N+2
- Beware of correlated failures. The group of related items that could fail together is a **failure domain** (individual zone in GCP)
  - deploy to multiple zones/regions
- Beware of cascading failures
  - use health checks + autoscale
- Positive feedback cycle overload failure
  - inteligent retry policy
  - circuit breaker design pattern
- Lazy deletion (trash -> soft deletion -> hard deletion -> backups)

### 8.3. Disaster Planning

- HA can be achieved by deploying to multiple zones in a region.
- Create a health check when creating instance groups to enable auto-healing
- If using Cloud SQL, create a failover replica for HA. Can be created in another zone in the same region. Doubles the cost of the DB.

- Recovery Point Objective - the amount of data that would be acceptable to lose (from 24 hrs for Ratings Service to 0 hrs for Orders Service (cannot lose any data))
- Recovery Time Objective - the amount of time it can take to be back up and running (from 1 hour for Rating Service to 2 minutes for Orders Service)

## 9. Security

### 9.1. Security Concepts

- Google Cloud security is a shared responsibility b/w you and Google
- Security is implemented in layers
- Principle of least privilege
- Separation of duties
  - use multiple projects to separate duties
  - different people can be given different rights in different projects
  - use folders to help organize projects
- Regularly audit the Google Cloud Logs to discover attacks
- Security Command Center provides access to org and project security configuration

### 9.2. Securing People

- To grant people access to your projects, add them as members and assign them one or more roles
- Use IAM policies to secure environments and manage resources
- Cloud IAP simplifies authorization to Google Cloud applications and VMs
- Identity Platform provides authentication as a service

### 9.3. Securing Machine Access

- Service Account can be used for machine or application identities
- Can use service accounts keys to configure the CLI - allows you to grant controlled Google Cloud access to developers w/o giving them access to the Cloud Console.

### 9.4. Network Security

- Remove external IPs to prevent access to machines outside their network (IAP to access machines, Cloud NAT to allow egress)
- private access allows access to Google Cloud services using an internal address
- control access to APIs using Cloud Endpoints
- Leverage Google Cloud network services for DDoS protection (LBs, Cloud CDN)
- Use Google Cloud Armor to create network security policies (allow list, deny list)
- Cloud Armor supports layer 7 web application firewall (WAF) rules

### 9.5. Encryption

- Google Cloud provides server-side encryption of data at rest by default
- for compliance reasons, you may need to manage your own keys - customer-supplied keys are created in your environment and provided to Google Cloud
- the Data Loss Prevention API can be used to protect sensitive data by finding it and redacting it

## 10. Maintenance and Monitoring

### 10.1. Managing Versions

- In a microservice arch. be careful not to break clients when services are updated.
- Rolling updates allow you to deploy new versions with no downtime
- use blue/green deployment when you do not wat multiple versions of a service running simultaneously.
  - blue = current version
  - green = entirely new environment
- Canary releases can be used before a rolling update to reduce the risk

### 10.2. Cost Planning

![Capacity planning is a continuous cycle](./img/07/10_36_38.png)

- preemptible + auto-healing to re-create VMs
- keep machines close to your data!!!
- Storage 1 GB in Firesore is free vs storing 1 GB in Bigtable ~ $ 1 400/month
- use GCP Pricing Calculator
- Billing reports provide detailed cost breakdowns, for advanced analysis, export billing data to BigQuery
- Visualize spend with Google Data Studio
- Set Budgets and alerts to one, several, or all projects
